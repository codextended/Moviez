The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Display a nice default placeholder graphic for each image during loading 
* [x] Improve the user interface through styling and coloring 
* [x] Expose details of movie (ratings using RatingBar, popularity, and synopsis) in a separate activity
* [x] Apply the popular ButterKnife annotation library to reduce view boilerplate.
* [x]  Add a rounded corners for the images using the Picasso transformations.
